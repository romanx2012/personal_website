    <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Roman Solorzano</strong>, and I'm 31 years old. I'm a proud dad to my amazing red-headed 10-year-old son who's in 4th grade and lives with me full time.</p>
    <p>My favorite color combo is <strong>blue and lime green</strong> — I love the way they pop together!</p>
    <p>I've worked at <strong>Darden Restaurants</strong> since I was 18, and I'm still there today — loyalty is big for me!</p>
    <p>My interests are super diverse: I enjoy <strong>Korean dramas, Mexican soap operas, American TV, anime, and YouTubers</strong>. My favorite show right now is <strong>Invincible</strong> on Prime Video.</p>
    <p>As for music, I'm a huge fan of <strong>Kings of Leon</strong>, and my favorite song from them is <em>The Bucket</em>.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I’m all about activity! I love playing <strong>disc golf</strong> and going for runs — I’ve even completed <strong>two full 26-mile marathons!</strong></p>
    <p>I drive a Chevy truck, and every weekend my friends and I have a blast with our regular <strong>game night</strong> sessions.</p>
