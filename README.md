# My Personal Website

This is a simple website I made for my class project.  
It has 3 pages: Home, About Me, and Portfolio.

Files in this Project

- index.html — The homepage
- about.html — Info about me
- portfolio.html — Some pretend projects
- style.css — Makes the site look nice
- javascript.js — A small Hello World script
- contact.css - Makes contact look nice
- contact.html - Gives way to contact

What I Used

- HTML
- CSS
- A little Javascript 

I’m still learning but I’m proud of how this came out!  
Here’s the link to my live site that is still in progress:
